# Pedigree With Multiple Fathers Desktop App

## Project Overview

This desktop application project, known as "Pedigree With Multiple Fathers" was initiated by Chris, who was approached by a friend in need of a specialized pedigree creation tool. Recognizing the unique requirements of this project, Chris collaborated with Jørn to bring this concept to life. Development commenced on 25 December 2022, with the goal of creating pedigrees that allow for individuals to have multiple potential fathers (distinguished by dotted lines) and organizing individuals based on year of birth. While adhering to this specific use case, the project also focuses on maintaining compatibility with standard pedigree formats.

## Versions

To cater to a broader audience, this project is available in two versions, each with its own set of features and limitations:
- Please read the ReadMe file for the version you select on how to use the version and what limitations it may have.
- This program only supports Windows 7 and newer.

### Version 1.0

- ID for each entity must begin with either 'M', 'F', or 'U' depending on the sex of the individual.
- If a numerical ID is entered, the application will automatically assign the appropriate letter based on the sex of the individual.
- Has limit of 290 years for pedigrees (e.g. 2000-2290).
- Individuals where only father(s) is known cannot be accounted for. There must be no parents, only a mother or both a mother and father(s).

### Version 2.0 (Work in progress)

- Each individual must have a unique numerical ID.
- Use of 'M', 'F', or 'U' as prefixes for IDs is not permitted.
- Has limit of 290 years for pedigrees (e.g. 2000-2290).
- Individuals where only father(s) is known cannot be accounted for. There must be no parents, only a mother or both a mother and father(s).

**Note:** Version 2.0 is currently a work in progress and is not yet available for use. We expect to release it soon, so stay tuned for updates.
